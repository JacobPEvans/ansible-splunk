# MCP Server app local configuration
# Generated by Ansible - do not edit manually
#
# SPIKE NOTE: This configuration format must be verified against the actual
# Splunk MCP Server app package (Splunkbase app 7931). Inspect the app's
# default/app.conf and any README files in the archive to confirm the correct
# stanza name and key for token-based authentication.
#
# Common Splunk app patterns for auth tokens:
#   [authentication] token = <value>
#   [mcp] api_token = <value>
#   [server] token = <value>
#
# Update this template after inspecting the app package and testing.

[authentication]
token = {{ splunk_docker_mcp_token }}
