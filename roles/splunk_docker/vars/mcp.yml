# Splunk MCP Server configuration
#
# The Splunk MCP Server (Splunkbase app 7931) provides MCP (Model Context
# Protocol) tools for AI agents: run_splunk_query, get_indexes, etc.
#
# SPIKE NOTE: The exact configuration format for this app must be verified
# by inspecting the actual app package archive. The template at
# templates/mcp_server_app.conf.j2 uses a common Splunk app pattern for
# token-based authentication - adjust after inspecting the app's README
# or default configuration files.
#
# The authentication token should be generated and stored in Doppler as
# SPLUNK_MCP_TOKEN before running the playbook.

splunk_docker_mcp_server_enabled: true

# MCP token loaded from SPLUNK_MCP_TOKEN env var in site.yml
# Empty string means the task file will skip token configuration
splunk_docker_mcp_token: ""
